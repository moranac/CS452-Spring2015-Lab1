My solution to this lab was to first create the three sets of vertices for each shape (square, triangle, hexagon),
create a buffer for each shape, and initialize the vertex-shader to display the triangle first. Then I created an event function
called "click" that would run whenever a mouse click occurred. This event would first check the value of the variable "index" to 
decide which shape was to be displayed next. Once this was determined, the corresponding buffer was binded and the vertex-shader 
was updated. Also the variable "sides" was updated to accommodate the different number of sides for each shape. Lastly, an event
listener was added to the canvas to allow the user to click anywhere on the canvas to change the displaying shape.
